# Introduction

Code is a well-structured implementation of a bigram language model with Laplace smoothing. 
Following is a breakdown of its functionality and potential improvements:

## Code Functionality:

### Preprocessing

The preprocess_corpus function cleans the corpus text by removing punctuation and special character (customizable) and then tokenizes and lowercases the words.

### Bigram Model Building

The build_bigram_model function constructs a bigram model with Laplace smoothing using a dictionary to store bigram counts. This ensures unseen bigrams have a non-zero probability.

### Sentence Generation

The generate_sentence function generates a sentence by iteratively choosing the most probable word based on the bigram model and the previous word, stopping when an end punctuation mark is encountered.

### Evaluation

The evaluate_test_set function calculates the average and standard deviation of sentence probabilities for a given test set. It handles unseen bigrams by assigning a probability of 0.

### Improvements:

#### Smoothing Factor

While Laplace smoothing (smoothing_factor=1) is a common approach, other smoothing factors may be used to see if it affects the model's performance.

#### Handling Unseen Bigrams

Currently, unseen bigrams are assigned a probability of 0 in the evaluation. You could explore alternative strategies like backoff to unigram probabilities or assigning a small non-zero probability for unseen bigrams.

#### More Complex Test Sets

The provided test set is very small. Consider creating a larger and more diverse test set to get a better evaluation of the model's generalization capabilities.

#### Model Selection

Bigram models are relatively simple. Consider exploring trigram models or n-gram models with higher n values for potentially better performance. However, these models require more training data and computational resources.

Overall, the code demonstrates a good understanding of bigram language models and their evaluation. By incorporating the suggested improvements, you can further enhance the model's robustness and performance.
