    "- **P(s'|s,a)**: Transition probability to next state s'\n",
    "- **R(s,a,s')**: Immediate reward from taking action a in state s\n",
    "- **γ**: Discount factor (1.0 for our finite horizon problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: V₀(s) = 0 for all states s\n",
    "2. **Iterate**: For k = 0, 1, 2, ... until convergence:\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding how **market uncertainty** affects optimal decision-making is crucial for validating our dynamic programming solution. This analysis compares strategies learned in dynamic environments versus what would be optimal under static conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparative Analysis Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dynamic Environment (Our Implementation)**\n",
    "- **Market Behavior**: Random transitions between Market States 1 and 2\n",
    "- **Transition Probability**: 50% chance of each state daily\n",
    "- **Strategic Requirement**: Policy must adapt to uncertainty\n",
    "- **Optimal Approach**: Robust strategies that perform well across market conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Static Environment Scenarios (Theoretical Comparison)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario A: Always Market State 1**\n",
    "- **Fixed Prices**: Product A = $8, Product B = $2 (permanent)\n",
    "- **Optimal Strategy**: Always maximize Product A production\n",
    "- **Decision Rule**: Simple heuristic - produce as much A as possible\n",
    "- **Risk**: Vulnerable if market conditions were to change\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario B: Always Market State 2**  \n",
    "- **Fixed Prices**: Product A = $3, Product B = $5 (permanent)\n",

    "- **Decision Rule**: Simple heuristic - focus entirely on Product B\n",
    "- **Risk**: Suboptimal if Product A becomes profitable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Value of Adaptation**: How much additional profit does the dynamic policy generate compared to static strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness vs Specialization**: Does the dynamic policy sacrifice peak performance in specific conditions for overall robustness?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategy Flexibility**: How does optimal behavior change when facing uncertainty versus certainty?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Risk-Return Trade-offs**: Does uncertainty change the risk profile of optimal strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Premium**: Additional value from adapting to market changes\n",
    "- **Hedging Strategies**: How optimal policy balances risk across market states  \n",
    "- **Information Value**: Worth of knowing market conditions will change\n",
    "- **Strategic Robustness**: Stability of performance across different scenarios"
