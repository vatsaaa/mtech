    "Develop a reinforcement learning agent using dynamic programming to help a Smart Supplier decide which products to manufacture and sell each day to maximize profit. The agent must learn the optimal policy for choosing daily production quantities, considering its limited raw materials and the unpredictable daily demand and selling prices for different products.\n",

    "#### **Scenario**\n",
    " A small Smart Supplier manufactures two simple products: Product A and Product B. Each day, the supplier has a limited amount of raw material. The challenge is that the market demand and selling price for Product A and Product B change randomly each day, making some products more profitable than others at different times. The supplier needs to decide how much of each product to produce to maximize profit while managing their limited raw material.\n",

    "#### **Objective**\n",
    "The Smart Supplier's agent must learn the optimal policy π∗ using dynamic programming (Value Iteration or Policy Iteration) to decide how many units of Product A and Product B to produce each day to maximize the total profit over the fixed number of days, given the daily changing market conditions and limited raw material."
