## Instructions for submission:
- Follow IST time zone for due time of submission uploads
- Only one submission per group is sufficient.
- Submission requires below documents. 
    - A word file containing theory part including:
        - Justification toward your design of logic, the static evaluation function, change made to the algorithm/code. A screenshot of the output should be appended in the document with date time stamp visible and the entire code execution too with clear output flow.
        - The decision tree given have to be used as the input to the design of logic wherever applicable.  And screenshots of the prolog based output should be appended in the document and the entire code execution too with clear output flow.
    - Two Executable Files: 
        - The Python notebook (.ipynb file) implementing GAME.
        - The prolog file (.pl file) implementing LOGIC 
- Mandatory requirement: List the active team members with BITS ID, who effectively contributed to the assignment at the top of the python file. Inactive students of the group as endorsed through the details shared by group members will not awarded any assignment marks.
- Irrespective of the number of members in the group, the evaluation will depend only on the single submission representing the group, uniformly for the entire class.

## Evaluation criteria
- Refer to the problem statement documents for the detailed evaluation criteria for the problem.
- Neat and efficient code.
- The required output (Solution, Sequence of Assignments & backtracked variables, Dynamic inputs in Game) to be printed as mentioned in the problem. Print the change in alpha beta values in every propagation. ATLEAST FOR ONE PLAYER THE PROGRAM SHOULD GET THE DYNAMIC GAME MOVES FROM THE USER similar to the webinar demo'd program.
- For the logic program its MANDATORY to dynamically get the inputs from the users to simulate the expert system and students MUST PROVIDE SAMPLE INPUT SEQUENCES & EXPECTED OUTPUT IN THE WORD DOCUMENT. 
- Any groups found to be involved in plagiarism will be penalized without notification at the discretion of the evaluator. No more excuses/requests will be entertained for the same
- Plan ahead to submit early. No more extension of the date for submission is possible.
- DO NOT publish the questions or solutions in the public forum as its internal to BITS WILP use. If done itâ€™s implied that you are encouraging plagiarism. This is applicable for all the evaluation components materials you are being given marks.
