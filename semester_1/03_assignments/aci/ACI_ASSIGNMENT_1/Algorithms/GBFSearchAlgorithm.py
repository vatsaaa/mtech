    Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm implementation.

    This algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the search space based on a heuristic function.
    It expands the node with the lowest heuristic value, prioritizing the most promising paths towards the goal.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        search(grid_env: GridEnvironment) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, int]], int]:
            Performs the greedy best-first search on the given grid environment.

        heuristic(row: int, col: int) -> int:
            Calculates the heuristic value for a given cell in the grid.

        time_complexity() -> str:
            Returns the time complexity of the algorithm.

        space_complexity() -> str:
            Returns the space complexity of the algorithm.
