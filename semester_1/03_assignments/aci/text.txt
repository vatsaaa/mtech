We have a graph of nodes, where we perform a tree search. 
There are 2 goal nodes, G1 and G2. 
E is a successor of itself. A is the initial node. 
G1 and G2 are the destination nodes, depicted with double circles.

The following direct node paths are valid, there are no other direct paths between the nodes:
A to B
A to C
B to C
C to E
E to E
C to D
D to G1
D to G2

StepCosts( ) from one node to the other are given below. 
StepCosts( ) takes "from-node" as first parameter and second parameter can only the very next "successor-node". 
StepCost(A, B) = 4
StepCost(A to C) = 10
StepCost(B to C) = 3
StepCost(C to E) = 6
StepCost(E to E) = 10
StepCost(C to D) = 10
StepCost(D to G1) = 6
StepCost(D to G2) = 5

StepCost( ) outputs the cost of going from "from-node" to "successor-node"; as given above.

Heuristic values for each node are mentioned on the node as below: 
h(A) = 21, h(B) = 18, h(C) = 15, h(D) = 5, h(E) = 4, h(G1)= 0, h(G2) = 0 

Once the graph is analysed, please say "READY". I will ask the questions.


DFS = 26
GBFS = 26
UCS = 22
A* = 22
Breadth First Search = 26
IDS = 26
