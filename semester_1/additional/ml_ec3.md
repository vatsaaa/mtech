# Supervised Learning

- Models trained on labeled data, and the goal is to learn a mapping from the input features to the output labels
- Dataset, from which models must learn, consists of input features and their corresponding output labels
- Models learns the relationship between the input features and the output labels by minimizing a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual output labels

## Linear regression

### Introduction

- Simple and widely used regression technique that models relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables
- Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables
- The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values

### Algorithm

- Parameteric algoithm of the form y = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub> * x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2</sub> + ... + b<sub>n</sub>*x<sub>n</sub>
- The linear regression algorithm works by finding the coefficients of the linear equation that best fits the data.
- Coefficients are estimated using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) = 1/n * sum((y - y_pred)^2)
- Optimization: Minimize the loss function using gradient descent or normal equation
- Normal equation: b = (X<sup>T</sup> * X)<sup>-1</sup> * X<sup>T</sup> * y
- Gradient descent: b = b - ⍺ * $\frac{1}{n}$ * X<sup>T</sup> * (X * b - y)
- Predict the output of a new data point using the linear equation

### Variations

## Radial Basis Functions

### Introduction

- RBF: A function that transforms the input space into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function
  - Gaussian RBF: e<sup>(-γ * ||x - x0||²)</sup>
  - Multiquadric RBF: √(||x - x0||² + c²)
  - Inverse Multiquadric RBF: $\frac{1}{√(||x - x0||² + c²)}$
  - Thin Plate Spline RBF: ||x - x0||² * log(||x - x0||)
  - Wendland Compactly Supported RBF: $\frac{(1 - ||x - x0||)⁷ * (35 * ||x - x0||² + 18 * ||x - x0|| + 3}{3}$

## Algorithm

- A radial basis function (RBF) is a function that assigns a weight to each training example based on its distance from the query point.
- The weight is calculated using a kernel function.
- The weight is used to calculate the output of the query point.
- The output of the query point is a linear combination of the weights and the training examples.

- Effective in reducing the impact of outliers
- Improves the accuracy of the regression model by assigning higher weights to the training examples that are closer to the query point. This ensures that the model is more sensitive to the training examples that are relevant to the query point.

## Choice of Centers

- Centers are the points in the input space around which the RBFs are centered.
- The centers can be chosen randomly, using k-means clustering, or using other methods.
- The choice of centers can affect the performance of the RBF network by influencing the coverage of the input space. e.g. If the centers are too far apart, the RBF network may not be able to capture the local structure of the data. If the centers are too close together, the RBF network may overfit the data.

### Slack Variables, Soft and Hard Margin SVM

- Soft Margin SVM (C = $\frac{1}{λ}$, where λ is the regularization strength parameter): Allows for a certain number of misclassifications
- Hard Margin SVM (C = 0): Does not allow for any misclassifications
- C: Regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the misclassification
- Large C: Emphasizes minimizing the misclassification
- Small C: Emphasizes maximizing the margin
- Slack variables: ξ<sub>i</sub>: Measure of how much a data point violates the margin
- Soft Margin SVM optimization: Minimize $\frac{1}{2}$ * ||w||² + C * Σξ<sub>i</sub> subject to y<sub>i</sub> * (w<sup>T</sup> * x<sub>i</sub> + b) >= 1 - ξ<sub>i</sub>

### Non-Linear SVM

The following issues are encountered with linear SVM

- Sensitive to noise: Outliers can affect the decision boundary
- Not suitable for non-linear data: Linear SVM cannot capture non-linear relationships between variables
- Memory inefficiency: Linear SVM requires storing the entire dataset in memory
- Choice of Kernel affects the performance of the SVM by influencing the complexity of the decision boundary
- Kernel parameters need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance
- Optimization criterion may not be convex, leading to local minima

Hence, Non-Linear SVM is used to address these issues.

#### Algorithm

- Non-linear SVM uses the kernel trick to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space where it is linearly separable
- Common kernels: Polynomial, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Sigmoid
- Kernel function: K(x, x') = φ(x) * φ(x')

# Naive Bayes Classifier

## Algorithm

- NB is a popular and simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes theorem with naive assumption of the features.
- Assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
- e.g. A fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features.
- This assumption simplifies computation and makes the model interpretable and computationally efficient.

## Numerical Example

## Advantages

## Stacking

### Introduction

- Ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models via an external meta-model/meta-classifier/meta-regressor to improve the performance of the overall model.
- The base models are trained on the training data and their predictions are used as input features for the stack generalization meta-model.
- Base models are of different types, and are trained on different subsets of training data
- Difference w.r.t bagging and boosting: Combines the predictions of multiple models rather than combining the models themselves.
- Benefit: Stacking captures the strengths of different models and improves the overall performance of the model as compare to any one of the individual models.

### Algorithm

- Stacking begins by training multiple diverse base models on the training data. 
- Common base learners: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
- Holdout data: A portion of the training data is set aside as holdout data to train the meta-model.
